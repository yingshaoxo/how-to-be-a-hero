# Merry Christmas in Advance

Send scheduled for Wed, Dec 23, 11:58 AM



Recently I adopted a stray cat.



I know it sounds silly since I couldn't take care of myself well yet, but I did it because I couldn't control my stupid kindness.

Can you imagine a cat dying in the cold winter winds? If I didn't bring it to my house, it would die cold soon or later this winter.

Anyway, I did it. Along with that decision, almost immediately, I bought the cat food, cat cage, and Flea spray from the TaoBao. So I can raise this cat in a more modern and technical way.

For example, I could give it a Shower with the help of the cat cage so it won't hurt me. Or use Flea spray to clean those disgusting Parasites.

The drawback for this cat is that it's just too Sticking. It goes everywhere I go. And whenever I take a set, it'll just jump to my legs. \(Hope it will change when he gets bigger. Oh yes, the gender of the cat is male\)



This event somehow reminds me, if, for a cat, I could spend 160 RMB without hesitation, why I didn't do the same thing to you? That's a good question. Should the cat be more valuable than you? The answer is absolutely no.

So according to the Calendar, 24 or 25 is Christmas Day. **I decided to send you an apple as a gift for Christmas.**

**Happy Christmas!**
