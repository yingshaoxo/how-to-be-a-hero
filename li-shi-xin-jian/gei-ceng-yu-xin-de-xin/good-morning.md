# Good Morning

Send scheduled for Fri, Dec 4, 4:49 AM



Hi xiaozeng. It's good to see you before the day.  
The day of mine starts at night.  


  
I found that night is a good friend of mine if I want to use my brain to do some creative work or intelligent work.  
Here is what I said over Twitter:

> I have spent two days 6 hours per day and one night for one hour to solve an algorithm problem.   
> It's amazing to know that finally, I solved it.   
> The night is the best friend for a brain worker.  
> [https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/)  
>   
> The hardest part is that you should know a binary search tree is a special data structure. It has a feature that says the left node will always smaller than the right node.   
> I was trying to solve it as a normal binary tree at first but failed due to the complexity.  
>   
> Analyze problems with free drawing is also a good practice, by the way.

  
  
我花了两天时间\(白天在上班，基本上是下午4、5点到晚上10、11点\)，尝试去解决上次那个算法题。结果今天晚上1点多自然醒后花了一个小时就解决了\(没办法，醒来的时候感觉做梦都在想这个事情，觉得非做出来不可\)。  
所以即使问题看起来很难，坚持一下，解决问题的方法总是会被找到的。
