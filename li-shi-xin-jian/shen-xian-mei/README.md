The letter

\


\


Hi M!

\


\


Sincerely write this letter to you.

\


I still remember that last time you say that you don’t want me to talk to you only if it related to job.

\


Well, now, it is related to job.

\


It’s about my career path.

\


\


I recently found two jobs.&#x20;

\


One is in epam.&#x20;

\


Another is in a small company, where they ask me to do the flutter dev for the blockchains.

\


\


I’m here to ask you advice because I think you are important to me.&#x20;

\


I has a Netherlands friend, he said it’s not about money or position I got, it’s about the relationship for you and me.

\


He said that I should consider to talk with you in person. So that we could have some common vision or values.

\


\


I wanted to, but I’m afraid that you’ll refuse.

\


So let me explain the vision of mine:

\


I have to be strong enough to be able to go out, and find a job in Google.

\


Then I could qualified to be your boyfriend. This is for career only.

\


For the education degree, I’m afraid that I have to go to school again to fulfill something that’s missing in my life.

\


And the last one is the life status: I want to buy a house at countryside, in a forien country. Then I’ll just doing some remote job as a software engineer for living.

\


\


This is my vision so far. I don’t know if its gonna be real or not. But at least I got something to presuing.

\


\


How do you think, will you willing to join me if I made all those things come into reality?

\


\


And most importantly, would you agree that go out from my current position is the best way to achieve what I’ve dreamed about?

\
