The letter





Hi M!



Sincerely write this letter to you.

I still remember that last time you say that you don’t want me to talk to you only if it related to job.

Well, now, it is related to job.

\


It’s about my career path.

I recently found two jobs.&#x20;

One is in EPAM.&#x20;

Another is in a small company, where they ask me to do the flutter dev for the blockchains.





I’m here to ask you for advice because I think you are important to me.&#x20;





I have a Netherlands friend, he said it’s not about the money or position I got, it’s about the relationship between you and me.

He said that I should consider talking with you in person. So that we could have some common vision or values.

I wanted to, but I’m afraid that you’ll refuse.





So let me explain the vision of mine:

I have to be strong enough to be able to go out, and find a job at Google.

Then I could be qualified to be your boyfriend. This is for the career only.

For the education degree, I’m afraid that I have to go to school again to fulfill something that’s missing in my life.

And the last one is the life status: I want to buy a house in the countryside, in a foreign country. Then I’ll just be doing some remote job as a software engineer for a living.

This is my vision so far. I don’t know if it's gonna be real or not. But at least I got something to pursue.

\


\


How do you think, will you be willing to join me if I made all those things come into reality?\


And most importantly, would you agree that going out from my current position is the best way to achieve what I’ve dreamed about?
